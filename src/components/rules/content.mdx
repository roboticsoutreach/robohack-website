You've been hired by your government to remove nuclear waste from your nation.
Your aim is to transfer **radioactive cubes** from your nation's territory to that of your rival nation.
But be careful - it looks as though they're doing the same thing!

## Game Rules

1. The objective of the game, called **Nuclear Cleanup**, is to finish with as many radioactive cubes in your rival territory as possible.
2. The game is played between **two** robots.
3. Each match lasts for **150** seconds.
4. Robots will be started at the direction of match officials.
5. Each robot starts in its allocated starting zone.

    1. 1 point in the low scoring zone
    2. 3 points in the high scoring zone
8. Radioactive cubes outside the arena are worth no points.
9. The rival territory for a robot is on the opposite side of the arena to the robot's starting zone.

## Safety regulations

To confirm that your robot is safe, a safety inspection will be carried about by Southampton Robotics Outreach prior to the start of the competition. In order to pass a safety inspection, robots must:

1. Have a mess of less than 13 kg. Generally, teams should aim for their robot to be below 10 kg.
2. Have all electronics mounted securely with removeable fastenings. Cable ties, velcro and screws are recommended for this. Please do not affix anything to the boards with glue or double-sided tape.
3. Provide adequate protection to the batteries they use, including protection from mechanical damage. The provided hard case that secures the battery is highly recommended for this.
    1. Only batteries provided or authorised by Southampton Robotics Outreach may be used.
    2. The robot may only be powered through the Southampton Robotics Outreach power board.
    3. Battery charging at the event is only to be carried out by Southampton Robotics Outreach.
4. Have a power switch which will completely immobilise the robot. It must be accessible and obvious, without disassembling the robot in any way. It should be on top of the robot.
5. Be generally safe to handle.
6. Not contain any power system that exceeds 50 V.
